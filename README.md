        The Pwned Password validator checks the user's submitted password (in a registration or password change form) with the awesome HIBP Pwned Passwords service to see if it is a known pwned password. If the password has been pwned, it will fail validation,
        preventing the user from using that password in your app.

        This package provides an easily configurable view to display the message. Also included is JavaScript code to set a cookie when a user agrees with the cookie policy. The package will not display the dialog when that cookie has been set.
